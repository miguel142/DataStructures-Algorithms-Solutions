Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree | Set 2 (Using Parent Pointer)
Given values of two nodes in a Binary Tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). It may be assumed that both nodes exist in the tree.

BST_LCA

For example, consider the Binary Tree in diagram, LCA of 10 and 14 is 12 and LCA of 8 and 14 is 8.
