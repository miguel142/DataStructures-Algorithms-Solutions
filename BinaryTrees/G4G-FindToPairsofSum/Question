Find a pair with given sum in a Balanced BST
Given a Balanced Binary Search Tree and a target sum, write a function that returns true if there is a pair with sum equals to target sum, otherwise return false. Expected time complexity is O(n) and only O(Logn) extra space can be used. 
Any modification to Binary Search Tree is not allowed. Note that height of a Balanced BST is always O(Logn).
