Merge two BSTs with limited extra space
Given two Binary Search Trees(BST), print the elements of both BSTs in sorted form. The expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m is the number of nodes in first tree and n is the number of nodes in second tree. 
Maximum allowed auxiliary space is O(height of the first tree + height of the second tree
